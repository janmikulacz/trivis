# TřiVis

***Versatile, Reliable, and High-Performance Tool for Computing Visibility in Polygonal Environments***

## About

TřiVis, named after the Czech word *'tři'* (meaning *'three'*) and the term *'visibility'*, is a C++ library for computing visibility-related structures in 2D polygonal
environments.
It is based on the *triangular expansion algorithm* ([Bungiu et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3905); [Xu and Güting, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10707-014-0213-7)),
which uses preprocessing to convert the input polygonal environment into a triangular mesh, and then traverses the mesh to compute visibility regions, visibility graphs,
ray-shooting queries, and other visibility-related structures.

## Definitions

- **Polygonal Environment:** A 2D environment consisting of a single outer boundary and zero or more inner boundaries (holes), where each boundary is a simple polygon.
- **Triangular Mesh:** A mesh of triangles including adjacency information that covers the polygonal environment, where the intersection of any two triangles is either empty, a
  common edge, or a common vertex.
- **Point Location Query:** Determines the triangle of the triangular mesh that contains a given point in the polygonal environment or reports that the point is outside the
  environment.
- **Visibility:** Two points in the polygonal environment are visible to each other if the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the environment (touching the
  boundaries is allowed).
- **Two-Point Visibility Query:** Determines whether two given points in the polygonal environment are visible to each other.
- **Ray-Shooting Query:** Determines an intersection point of a ray starting at a given interior point in a given direction with the boundary of the polygonal environment.
- **Visibility Region Query:** Determines the region of the polygonal environment visible from a given interior point.
- **Visible Vertices Query:** Determines the subset of vertices of the polygonal environment visible from a given interior point.
- **Visible Points Query:** Determines the subset of given interior points that are visible from another given interior point.
- **Vertex-Vertex Visibility Graph:** A graph where vertices represent the vertices of the polygonal environment, and edges represent visibility between pairs of vertices.
- **Point-Point Visibility Graph:** A graph where vertices represent given interior points, and edges represent visibility between pairs of points.
- **Point-Vertex Visibility Graph:** A graph where vertices represent both given interior points and vertices of the polygonal environment, and edges represent visibility between
  pairs of points and vertices.
- **Limited Visibility Range:** A constraint on the visibility queries that restricts the visibility range to a given distance from the query point.

## Main Features

### Supported Queries

TřiVis supports all the queries defined [above](#definitions), each with a specialized, easy-to-use API.

### Worst-Case Query Complexity

The main feature of TřiVis is the *triangular expansion
algorithm* ([Bungiu et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3905); [Xu and Güting, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10707-014-0213-7)), which provides $O(n)$ query time for
two-point visibility and ray-shooting queries, $O(nh)$ for visibility region and visible vertices/points queries, $O(n^2h)$ for the vertex-vertex visibility graph, and $O(pnh)$ for
point-point and point-vertex visibility graphs.
Here, $n$ is the number of vertices in the polygonal environment, $h$ is the number of holes, and $p$ is the number of input interior points.

It is important to note that the query time complexity is worst-case, and the actual query time may be significantly lower in practice. This is especially true for TřiVis, as the
*triangular expansion algorithm* is known to exhibit output-sensitive behavior to some extent, traversing only the triangles that are partially or fully visible from the query
point ([Bungiu et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3905)).

### Efficient Limited-Range Queries

TřiVis supports limited-range queries, employing an early termination mechanism to avoid traversing unnecessary triangles of the triangular mesh.
This can significantly reduce the query time for queries with a highly restricted visibility range relative to the average size of the open space in the environment.

### Fast Point Location

TřiVis employs a bucketing technique to accelerate point location queries, which are essential for visibility-related queries.
Using the bucketing technique from ([Edahiro et al., 1984](https://doi.org/10.1145/357337.357338)), TřiVis achieves $O(1)$ expected query time for point location queries.

### Robustness and Reliability

TřiVis relies on floating-point arithmetic and incorporates a unique combination of adaptive robust geometry predicates ([Shewchuk, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00009321)) and
$\epsilon$-geometry ([Fortune and Van Wyk, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1145/160985.161015)).
Thanks to this combination, TřiVis is characterized by reliable and predictable behavior, free from crashing or infinite looping, providing consistent outputs that align with user
expectations, as supported by the results of our evaluation on exceptionally complex query instances.
For more information, refer to the [Performance Evaluation](#performance-evaluation) section.

### Performance on Large Instances

TřiVis has been tested on 34 complex polygonal environments with up to 8,320 vertices and 679 holes by computing visibility regions for 1,000 interior points in each environment.
With an average query time of 9±6μs, TřiVis outperforms other tested implementations by at least an order of magnitude, while keeping the preprocessing time below 20ms for the
tested polygonal environments.
For more information, refer to the [Performance Evaluation](#performance-evaluation) section.

## Building and Linking

TřiVis is built with [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

To make the library available to your C++ project, you can copy the [trivis/](trivis) directory and include it in your CMakeLists.txt:

```CMake
add_subdirectory(path_to_trivis) # Add the library to your project.
target_link_libraries(your_target PUBLIC Trivis) # Link the library to your target.
```

The build has been tested with the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 12.3.0 compiler and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.28.1 on the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 20.04.6 LTS operating
system.
For your convenience, the [conda/trivis.yml](conda/trivis.yml) file describes [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with the exact compiler and CMake versions used
by the authors.

To create and test the environment, run the following in the root directory of this repository:

```bash
# Assuming you have Conda installed:
conda env create -f conda/trivis.yml
conda activate trivis
gcc --version
cmake --version
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../trivis
make
```

Apart from TřiVis's source code, this repository also contains [TřiVis Pathfinder](#třivis-pathfinder), an extension adding support for pathfinding in polygonal environments, [TřiVis+](#třivis-1), an extension adding support for data loading and visualization, and an [Examples](#examples)
project depending on TřiVis+, demonstrating the library's usage.

For more information, refer to the [Repository Contents](#repository-contents) section.

## Basic Usage

### Initialization

To use the library in your C++ project, include the main header file:

```C++
#include "trivis/trivis.h"
```

TřiVis's main API is the `trivis::Trivis` class, which provides methods for visibility-related queries.
It is initialized with a polygonal environment represented by a `trivis::geom::PolyMap` object.

```C++
trivis::Trivis vis;
{   // Scope for the environment.
    trivis::geom::PolyMap environment;
    // TODO: Fill the environment.
    vis = trivis::Trivis{std::move(environment)};
}   // The environment was moved to vis.
```

The triangular mesh of the environment has just been constructed.
To inspect it, you can access the mesh directly through const reference:

```C++
const trivis::mesh::TriMesh &mesh = vis.mesh();
// TODO: Do something with the mesh.
```

### Computing Visibility Queries

To perform most of the visibility-related queries, you need to provide the query point, the point location result, and the visibility range (if limited).

```C++
trivis::geom::FPoint query;
// TODO: Fill the query.
std::optional<double> range;
// TODO: Set the visibility range or leave it unlimited.
std::optional<trivis::Trivis::PointLocationResult> plr = vis.LocatePoint(query);
if (plr.has_value()) {
    // The query point is inside the environment.
    // TODO: Perform visibility queries.
} else {
    // The query point is outside the environment.
    // TODO: Handle the case.
}
```

#### Two-Point Visibility Query

```C++
if (plr.has_value()) {
    trivis::geom::FPoint target;
    // TODO: Fill the target.
    bool is_visible = vis.IsVisible(query, plr.value(), target, range);
    // TODO: Do something with the visibility result.
}
```

#### Ray-Shooting Query

```C++
if (plr.has_value()) {
    trivis::geom::FPoint direction;
    // TODO: Fill the direction.
    std::optional<trivis::Trivis::RayShootingResult> rsr = vis.ShootRay(query, plr.value(), direction, range);
    if (rsr.has_value()) {
        trivis::geom::FPoint intersection = rsr->p;
        // TODO: Do something with the intersection point.
    } else {
        // The intersection point is outside the visibility range.
    }
}
```

#### Visibility Region Query

```C++
if (plr.has_value()) {
    trivis::AbstractVisibilityRegion abs_vis_region = vis.VisibilityRegion(query, plr.value(), range);
    trivis::RadialVisibilityRegion vis_region = vis.ToRadialVisibilityRegion(abs_vis_region);
    if (range.has_value()) {
        vis_region.IntersectWithCircleCenteredAtSeed(range);
    }
    // Optional post-processing:
    auto vis_region_appx = vis_region; // Copy the visibility region.
    if (range.has_value()) {
        vis_region_appx.SampleArcEdges(M_PI / 180.0); // Approximate circular arc edges with line segments.
    }
    trivis::geom::FPolygon vis_polygon_appx = vis_region_appx.ToPolygon();
    // TODO: Do something with the visibility polygon.
}
```

#### Visible Vertices Query

```C++
if (plr.has_value()) {
    std::vector<int> visible_vertices = vis.VisibleVertices(query, plr.value(), range);
    // TODO: Do something with the visible vertices.
}
```

#### Visible Points Query

```C++
// Prepare the input structures outside 'if (plr.has_value())' as they might be reused.
std::vector<trivis::geom::FPoint> input_points;
// TODO: Fill the input points.
std::vector<std::optional<trivis::Trivis::PointLocationResult>> input_plrs;
input_plrs.reserve(input_points.size());
for (const auto &p : input_points) {
input_plrs.push_back(vis.LocatePoint(p));
}
if (plr.has_value()) {
std::vector<int> visible_points = vis.VisiblePoints(query, plr.value(), input_points, input_plrs, range);
// TODO: Do something with the visible points.
}
```

#### Visibility Graphs

```C++
std::vector<std::vector<int>> vertex_vertex_graph = vis.VertexVertexVisibilityGraph(range);
// TODO: Do something with the vertex-vertex visibility graph.
std::vector<std::vector<int>> point_point_graph = vis.PointPointVisibilityGraph(input_points, input_plrs, range);
// TODO: Do something with the point-point visibility graph.
std::vector<std::vector<int>> point_vertex_graph = vis.PointVertexVisibilityGraph(input_points, input_plrs, range);
// TODO: Do something with the point-vertex visibility graph.
```

## TřiVis Pathfinder

TřiVis Pathfinder is a pathfinding extension of TřiVis that adds support for pathfinding in polygonal environments, i.e., finding the shortest path between two points in a
polygonal environment, or between all pairs of points in the environment.

It includes one additional, heavier dependency, which is why it is separated from the TřiVis (core) library:

1. [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), for algorithms and data structures used in pathfinding.

To make TřiVis Pathfinder available to your C++ project, you can copy the [trivis/](trivis) and [trivis_pathfinder/](trivis_pathfinder) directories and include them in your
CMakeLists.txt.

```CMake
add_subdirectory(path_to_trivis) # Add the library to your project.
add_subdirectory(path_to_trivis_pathfinder) # Add the extension to your project.
target_link_libraries(your_target PUBLIC TrivisPathfinder) # Link just the extension to your target.
```

### TřiVis Pathfinder Basic Usage

TODO !

### TřiVis Pathfinder Example

For usage example, refer to the end of the [Pathfinder Example](#pathfinder-example) section.

## TřiVis+

TřiVis+ is an extension of TřiVis that adds support for data loading and visualization, as well as some extra utilities.

It includes two additional, heavier dependencies, which is why it is separated from the TřiVis (core) library:

1. [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), for filesystem operations, program options and logging.
2. [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), for 2D graphics rendering.

To make TřiVis+ available to your C++ project, you can copy the [trivis/](trivis) and [trivis_plus/](trivis_plus) directories and include them in your CMakeLists.txt.

```CMake
add_subdirectory(path_to_trivis) # Add the library to your project.
add_subdirectory(path_to_trivis_plus) # Add the extension to your project.
target_link_libraries(your_target PUBLIC TrivisPlus) # Link just the extension to your target.
```

### TřiVis+ Examples

For usage examples, refer to the [Examples](#examples) section, particularly the source code in the [examples/](examples) directory.

## Examples

The example project located in the [examples/](examples) directory demonstrates the usage of TřiVis (and secondarily also TřiVis+).

To build the project, you may first need to create the respective Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f conda/trivis_boost_cairo.yml 
conda activate trivis
```

Alternatively, you may already have all the necessary dependencies installed.

Now, you need to set the environment variables to configure the build:

```bash
export TRIVIS_BUILD_TRIVIS_PLUS=1
export TRIVIS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=1
```

Alternatively, you may modify the [setup.bash](setup.bash) to fix the configuration and run `source setup.bash`.

Now, you can build the project:

```bash
bash build.bash
```

This will create the `build-Release` directory with the executables located in the `build-Release/examples` directory.

Now you can experiment with the examples and once you are done, you can inspect the source codes in the [examples/](examples) directory.

When experimenting with the examples, the default behavior is that the input polygonal environment is loaded from the [data/maps/](data/maps) directory, the text output is printed
to the console and the graphical output is saved to the [examples/outputs/](examples/outputs) directory.

Next are some examples of how to run the example executables.

#### 2-Point/Ray-Shooting Example

```bash
./build-Release/examples/vis_2point 
./build-Release/examples/vis_2point --vis-radius 10
./build-Release/examples/vis_2point --shoot-ray
./build-Release/examples/vis_2point --help # to see all options
```

#### Visibility Region Example

```bash
./build-Release/examples/vis_region
./build-Release/examples/vis_region --vis-radius 8
./build-Release/examples/vis_region --vis-radius 8 --sample-arc-edges 0.1
./build-Release/examples/vis_region --vis-radius 8 --sample-arc-edges 0.1 --to-polygon
./build-Release/examples/vis_region --help # to see all options
```

#### Visible Vertices Example

```bash
./build-Release/examples/vis_vertices
./build-Release/examples/vis_vertices --reflex-only
./build-Release/examples/vis_vertices --vis-radius 6
./build-Release/examples/vis_vertices --help # to see all options
```

#### Visibility Graph Example

```bash
./build-Release/examples/vis_graph
./build-Release/examples/vis_graph --reflex-only
./build-Release/examples/vis_graph --reflex-only --vis-radius 6
./build-Release/examples/vis_graph --point-vertex --reflex-only --vis-radius 6
./build-Release/examples/vis_graph --point-point
./build-Release/examples/vis_graph --help # to see all options
```

Once you are done experimenting with the examples, and you have inspected the source codes, you can start writing your own experimental code based on the examples.

For your convenience, we provide the [examples/sandbox.cc](examples/sandbox.cc) file, which you can use as a starting point for your own experiments.
It is built together with the examples by default, and you can run it as follows:

```bash
./build-Release/examples/sandbox --help # to see all options
```

#### Pathfinder Example

To build the Pathfinder example, you need to rebuild the project with the Pathfinder extension, which you can do by setting the following additional environment variable:

```bash
export TRIVIS_BUILD_TRIVIS_PATHFINDER=1
```

and then running the build script:

```bash
bash build.bash
```

## Performance Evaluation

TřiVis, or more specifically, its computation of visibility regions, has been extensively evaluated against several competing implementations on a dataset of 34 complex polygonal
environments.

**The competing implementations were:**

1. **CGAL-TEA-CE:** [CGAL's triangular expansion algorithm](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Visibility_2/classCGAL_1_1Triangular__expansion__visibility__2.html) (v5.6)
   with [exact constructions](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Kernel_23/classCGAL_1_1Exact__predicates__exact__constructions__kernel.html).
2. **CGAL-TEA-CI:** [CGAL's triangular expansion algorithm](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Visibility_2/classCGAL_1_1Triangular__expansion__visibility__2.html) (v5.6)
   with [inexact constructions](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Kernel_23/classCGAL_1_1Exact__predicates__inexact__constructions__kernel.html).
3. **CGAL-RSA-CE:** [CGAL's rotational sweep algorithm](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Visibility_2/classCGAL_1_1Rotational__sweep__visibility__2.html) (v5.6)
   with [exact constructions](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Kernel_23/classCGAL_1_1Exact__predicates__exact__constructions__kernel.html).
4. **CGAL-RSA-CI:** [CGAL's rotational sweep algorithm](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Visibility_2/classCGAL_1_1Rotational__sweep__visibility__2.html) (v5.6)
   with [inexact constructions](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Kernel_23/classCGAL_1_1Exact__predicates__inexact__constructions__kernel.html).
5. **VisiLibity1:** [**VisiLibity**](https://karlobermeyer.github.io/VisiLibity1/) (v1).

The evaluation is detailed in a manuscript currently (as of March 2024) submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

Below is a guide on how to replicate the performance evaluation from the manuscript.

### Replication Guide (Performance Evaluation)

#### Building the Project

The performance evaluation project is located in the [performance/](performance) directory.
It is dependent on the TřiVis+ extension, and includes two additional dependencies:

1. [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) (version 5.6), which can be installed system-wide or in a [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment.
2. [VisiLibity1](https://karlobermeyer.github.io/VisiLibity1/), which is included in the [performance/lib/](performance/lib) directory.

To build the project, you may first need to create the respective Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f conda/trivis_boost_cairo_cgal.yml
conda activate trivis
```

Alternatively, you may already have all the necessary dependencies installed.

Now, you need to set the environment variables to configure the build:

```bash
export TRIVIS_BUILD_TRIVIS_PLUS=1
export TRIVIS_BUILD_PERFORMANCE=1
```

Alternatively, you may modify the [setup.bash](setup.bash) to fix the configuration and run `source setup.bash`.

Building the project is now as simple as running:

```bash
bash build.bash
```

This will create the `build-Release` directory with the executables located in the `build-Release/performance` directory.

#### Getting the Dataset

> **Note:** The dataset was derived from the [Iron Harvest](https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/benchmarks/src/master/poly-maps/iron-harvest/)
> dataset ([Harabor et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1609/socs.v15i1.21770)).
> We have only preprocessed the dataset to TřiVis's input format by selecting the largest polygon per map, including its holes, and discarding the remaining polygons (mainly
> artifacts).
> If you are going to use the dataset, please give proper attribution to the authors of the original dataset.

Download the dataset from [here](https://imr.ciirc.cvut.cz/uploads/Downloads/trivis_performance_dataset.zip) and extract it to the [data/maps/](data/maps) directory.

#### Generating the Test Points

The following will generate the test points in the [data/points/](data/points) directory and save the CDT mesh for each map in the [data/meshes/](data/meshes) directory:

```bash
cd performance
bash gen_points_all.bash
```

#### Constructing the Visibility Regions

The following will construct the visibility regions by all the implementations and save the raw outputs in the [performance/outputs/](performance/outputs) directory:

```bash
bash test_all.bash # this may take several hours
```

#### Comparing the Results With the Reference Implementation (CGAL-TEA-CE)

The following will compare the results with the reference implementation and save the evaluation results in the [performance/results/csv/](performance/results/csv) directory:

```bash
bash eval_all.bash # this may take several minutes
rm outputs/* # you can now remove the raw outputs
```

#### Processing the Results

The results are processed with [datatable](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
To use it, you may need to create a Conda environment with the [conda/datatable.yml](conda/datatable.yml) file:

```bash
conda create env -f ../conda/datatable.yml
conda activate datatable
```

Now, you can process the results:

```bash
cd results
python process1.py
```

This will generate the `results.csv` file in the [performance/results/](performance/results) directory, which you can inspect and compare with the authors' results located in
the [performance/results/authors_results.csv](performance/results/authors_results.csv) file.

## Mesh Optimization

In our original research ([Mikula and Kulich, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-02561-y)), we have addressed the problem of improving the query performance
of the *triangular expansion algorithm* for computing visibility regions by finding the most advantageous instance of the triangular mesh.

TřiVis (in its earlier stages of development) was used as the basecode for the research, and the mesh optimization project in the [mesh_optim/](mesh_optim) implemented the mesh
optimization algorithms and experiments.

Below is a guide on how to replicate the experiments from the research.

### Replication Guide (Mesh Optimization)

> **Note:** The results presented in [Mikula and Kulich (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-02561-y) were obtained using earlier version of
> TřiVis ([0.3.0](http://imr.ciirc.cvut.cz/uploads/Research/trivis-sn-comp-sci.zip)).
> The current version of [mesh_optim/](mesh_optim) project has been later updated to work with the current versions of TřiVis and TřiVis+.
> However, due to the extensive experiments, the authors have not yet had the time to test the updated version of the project on the full dataset.

#### Building the Project

The mesh optimization project is located in the [mesh_optim/](mesh_optim) directory.
It is dependent on the TřiVis+ extension.

To build the project, you may first need to create the respective Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f conda/trivis_boost_cairo_python.yml
conda activate trivis
```

Alternatively, you may already have all the necessary dependencies installed.

Now, you need to set the environment variables to configure the build:

```bash
export TRIVIS_BUILD_TRIVIS_PLUS=1
export TRIVIS_BUILD_MESH_OPTIM=1
```

Alternatively, you may modify the [setup.bash](setup.bash) to fix the configuration and run `source setup.bash`.

Building the project is now as simple as running:

```bash
bash build.bash
```

This will create the `build-Release` directory with the executables located in the `build-Release/mesh_optim` directory.

#### Getting the Dataset

> **Note:** The dataset was derived from the [Iron Harvest](https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/benchmarks/src/master/poly-maps/iron-harvest/)
> dataset ([Harabor et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1609/socs.v15i1.21770)).
> We have only preprocessed the dataset to TřiVis's input format by selecting the largest polygon per map, including its holes, and discarding the remaining polygons (mainly
> artifacts).
> Additionally, we have generated simple-polygon versions of the maps, as described in detail in the
> manuscript ([Mikula and Kulich, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-02561-y)).
> If you are going to use the dataset, please give proper attribution to the authors of the original dataset.

Download the dataset from [here](https://imr.ciirc.cvut.cz/uploads/Downloads/trivis_mesh_optim_dataset.zip) and extract it to the [data/maps/](data/maps) directory.

#### Running the Experiments

To replicate every single experiment from [Mikula and Kulich (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-02561-y), run the following:

```bash
cd mesh_optim/experiments
bash run_experiments_all.bash # this may take a few days
cd ../..
```

Alternatively, you can inspect the scripts in the [mesh_optim/experiments/](mesh_optim/experiments) directory and run them individually.

#### Processing the Results

The results are processed with [datatable](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To use it, you may need to create a Conda environment with
the [conda/datatable.yml](conda/datatable.yml) file:

```bash
conda create env -f conda/datatable.yml
conda activate datatable
```

To process all the results, run the following:

```bash
cd mesh_optim/results
bash process_all.bash # this may take several minutes
cd ../..
```

Alternatively, you can inspect the scripts in the [mesh_optim/results/](mesh_optim/results) directory and run them individually.

The results are saved in the [csv/](mesh_optim/results/csv), [figures/](mesh_optim/results/figures), and [tables/](mesh_optim/results/tables) subdirectories of
the [mesh_optim/results/](mesh_optim/results) directory.

## Documentation

Currently, TřiVis lacks detailed documentation beyond this README file due to time constraints faced by the authors.
However, the simplicity of the API, coupled with the guidance provided in the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) section and the examples available in the [examples/](examples)
directory (further explained in the [Examples](#examples) section), should facilitate seamless adoption of TřiVis for users.
